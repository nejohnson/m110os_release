# Updating Firmware

To update firmware in the M110SX module you will need:
* A computer with a MIDI 1.0 interface running sequencer software that can play a MIDI file
* MIDI cable between the computer and the JEN SX1000
* One of the update files below

The process is as follows:
1. Make sure your JEN SX1000 is set to MIDI channel 1 (hold down the lowest key then turn on)
1. Load the firmware MIDI file into your sequencer
1. Turn off your JEN SX1000
1. Hold down the C4 and C5 keys then turn it on
1. The M110SX is now in firmware update mode
1. Hit PLAY on the sequencer software
1. On successful firmware download the JEN SX1000 will play three short notes to indicate success.  If you don't hear anything then something went wrong and you must start again.
